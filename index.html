        <p class="text-muted">This Church was built in 1928, but unfortunately the 'History' link on the Church's website is blank. The white marble tablet for the Foundation Stone to the right of the entry is in Latin, so difficult for me to read.

          The Church is built of dark brown bricks, with white highlights over the arched windows and door. A very tall bell is attached to the southern side of the western (entry) end and is surmounted by a 'Celtic' or Latin Cross. High above the entry is a statue in an alcove, but with my mobile phone I wasn't able to get enough zoom to capture that. A low (3 foot) dark brown brick fence, with white highlighted arched pillars is at the footpath. There is off-street parking for the parishioners.
          
          Workmen inside had the inner door barricaded - for safety. There is a Memorial sign, and Dedicated Tree near the entry for those that served in World War One.</p>

 <p class="text-muted">PEORIA… State Representative Ryan Spain (R-Peoria) announced over $17,000 will be awarded to 73rd District school libraries in the coming weeks from Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White’s office as part of the School District Library Grant Program.

  “School libraries are an important resource for students and educators and I am very happy to see this funding go to benefit students in our area,” said Rep. Ryan Spain in response to the grant announcement.
  
  School districts that applied for the grant are awarded at least $750 to improve their library services.  This program is designed to help provide more library books and materials for students at public schools in Illinois.  The state legislature has authorized up to $.75 per pupil expenditure for qualifying schools.  The grant award is based on funds appropriated by the Illinois General Assembly and the official enrollment as of the previous September 30th of a school district.</p>

    <p class="text-muted">The auditorium is a central and important space in any high school lucky enough to have one. ... The acoustical design of an auditorium is different than that of any other high school space, because of the specific demands of the performing arts, which distinguish the auditorium from a common lecture hall.</p>
